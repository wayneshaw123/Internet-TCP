# Internet-TCP
This is the project and report that I (Weiheng Xia) did in the Communication Systems module.
I implemented the client part with my teammate Andrew Mooreï¼Œand we cooperated with another team, Beibei and Marc. 
We designed and implemented an Application Layer Protocol in C, to transfer files between two computers based on the interfaces of TCP.
