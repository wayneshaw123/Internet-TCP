# Internet-TCP
This is the project and report that I did in the Communication Systems module.
I implemented the client part with my teammate Andrew Mooreï¼Œ and we cooperated with another team, Beibei and Mark. 
We designed and implemented an Application Layer Protocol in C, to transfer files between two computers based on the interfaces of TCP.
